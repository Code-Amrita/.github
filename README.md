## Core Competition Focus: ICPC

At **Code @ Amrita**, we encourage all members to participate in the **International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC)**, the world’s most prestigious university-level coding competition. While Code @ Amrita does not organize ICPC, it remains a core focus of our competitive programming efforts, providing dedicated training and resources to help members succeed at each stage.

### Why ICPC Participation Matters

- **Skill Mastery in Algorithms and Data Structures:**  
  ICPC problems demand an advanced understanding of algorithms, data structures, and optimizations, pushing members to their technical limits.

- **Global Recognition and Career Opportunities:**  
  Many top tech companies highly value ICPC experience, often recruiting participants for their skills, resilience, and dedication.

- **Amrita Representation on a Global Stage:**  
  Competing in ICPC gives Amrita students the chance to showcase their skills on an international platform, fostering pride and growth within our university community.

Through mentorship, regular practice, and mock contests, Code @ Amrita helps members build the skills and confidence they need to excel in ICPC and beyond.
